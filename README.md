In this project, a heuristic evaluation was conducted to compare the user experience (UX) of two leading quick-commerce platforms — Blinkit and Zepto. 
Both applications provide similar core functionalities such as product search, instant delivery, and digital payment integration. 
However, through analysis based on Nielsen’s usability heuristics, several gaps in homepage design were identified. 
When visiting Blinkit’s homepage, users are immediately presented with multiple promotional banners, pop-up offers, and overlapping visuals. 
While these aim to highlight deals, they often create a cluttered and distracting interface, 
making it difficult for users to focus on finding and ordering items quickly. 
Similarly, Zepto’s homepage contains numerous stacked sections and densely packed product categories, 
which can feel overwhelming and visually congested, particularly on smaller screens. 
The excessive use of images and promotional elements in both platforms tends to slow page loading and reduce overall browsing efficiency. 
In contrast, a homepage with a clean, minimal layout featuring one primary banner and two to three key product sections would guide 
user attention more effectively, improving usability, navigation flow, and overall satisfaction.

To address these identified shortcomings, the redesigned homepage focuses on simplicity, clarity, and user-centered navigation. 
The overall interface employs a balanced and spacious layout with just one main promotional banner and three neatly 
organized product sections — Daily Products, Snacks, and Personal Care. This structure ensures that users can quickly locate essential
categories without being distracted by excessive visuals or pop-ups. The use of soft pastel backgrounds, uniform typography, 
and clearly labeled icons enhances readability and maintains a calm visual flow, in contrast to the dense and banner-heavy designs of Blinkit and Zepto. 
A prominently positioned search bar at the top enables faster access to desired items, while consistent spacing and compact image sizing prevent clutter 
and improve loading performance. By reducing visual noise and emphasizing direct interaction, the new layout delivers a refined, lightweight, and 
accessible user experience, encouraging users to browse, select, and order products effortlessly. Overall, the redesign transforms 
the homepage into a visually harmonious and functionally efficient interface that promotes focus, speed, and satisfaction.

## Result:

The Heuristic Evaluation of an Existing Website or App is created and verified
